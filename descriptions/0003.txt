Description

DATASET DISCLAIMER: Spatial location of road crashes within the ACT since 2012 which have been reported by the Police or the Public through the AFP Crash Report Form. This dataset only represents crashes that have been reported using the AFP Crash Report Form, and any crashes which have been reported through other channels are not displayed within this dataset. Note that this data may not represent the exact spatial location of each reported road crash, as the points of each crash are purely indicative of the intersection or midblock location as indicated by the point attributes. Crashes are reviewed on an annual basis, so the existing data may change over time as a result of this review.
