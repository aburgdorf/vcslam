It is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon represents one space. Subsequent versions will provide updates on a quarterly basis.

This dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment.
