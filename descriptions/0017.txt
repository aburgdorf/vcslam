Description

The Seattle Police Department (SPD) replaced its Records Management System (RMS) in May 2019. To preserve data quality and continuity between systems (2008-Present), SPD relied on the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The standardization of crime classifications allows for comparison over time. For more information on definitions and classifications, please visit https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/nibrs.

Additional groupings are used to analyze crime in SPDâ€™s Crime Dashboard. Violent and property crime categories align with best practices. For additional inquiries, we encourage the use of the underline data to align with the corresponding query.

Disclaimer: Only finalized (UCR approved) reports are released. Those in draft, awaiting approval, or completed after the update, will not appear until the subsequent day(s). Data is updated once every twenty-four hours. Records and classification changes will occur as a report makes its way through the approval and investigative process
