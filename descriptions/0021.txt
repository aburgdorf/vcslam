Description

Seattle’s Building Energy Benchmarking Program (SMC 22.920) requires owners of non-residential and multifamily buildings (20,000 square feet or larger) to track energy performance and annually report to the City of Seattle. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency.

Per Ordinance (125000), starting with 2015 energy use performance reporting, the City of Seattle will make the data for all building 20,000 SF and larger available annually. This dataset contains all 2018 buildings required to report.
