Description

Rainfall is measured to assess storms and their effects on flooding and sewer performance and design.

Rainfall location color icons indicate rainfall totals and maximum storm rating during the past 24 hours. Data is sent once 2mm is accumulated in each gauge, so timing will vary.

Website is updated every 15 minutes . Higher storm ratings and rainfall totals may have occurred if a storm lasts more than 24h. Storm ratings and rainfall are based on data at the gauge location only - nearby areas may experience differing conditions due to variability of rainstorms.

Rainfall is measured between May and October; snowfall is not measured.

TOTAL_AMOUNT_FALLEN_PAST_24_HOURS	
Rolling 24-hour rainfall total, in millimetres. Values will hold steady until the next data point restarts the calculations, until the following 23:59:59 at the latest (gauge sends a zero data point each day at 23:59:59 so there is always recent data if not raining).

STORM_RATING_ID	
Unique identifier for the Storm Rating Description. Maximum Rating over past 24 hours. Values will hold steady until the next data point restarts the calculations, until the following 23:59:59 at the latest. Calculation based on rainfall total and intensity, land characteristics in the area (e.g.-amount of pavement), and an index for wetness of the ground.
