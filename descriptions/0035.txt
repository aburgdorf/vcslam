Description

Distribution of various currently-licensed pets (cats, dogs, pigeons) by neighbourhood.

Note that this is a snapshot of pets that were licensed as of the last update date of this dataset; if a pet was licensed a number of years ago but that license has since expired and not been renewed, the details of that pet will not appear in this dataset. It is therefore not possible to use this dataset to see trends in pet licensing over time.

The rows with a year value of '2017' for example do not represent a comprehensive list of all pets that were licensed in 2017, but rather the subset of those pets that are still licensed as of the last update date of this dataset.
