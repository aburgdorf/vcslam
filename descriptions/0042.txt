Description

This dataset provides information on the location and operators of permitted clothing drop boxes.

The Clothing Drop Box by-law ensures that the public is aware of where used clothing donations are going, creates a registry of clothing box owners, and deters litter and unsightly views for residents.

Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 395, "Clothing Drop Boxes", requires that all clothing drop box operators obtain a location permit for each box. All operators, including charitable organizations, must display the permit sticker on the box.

    For more information refer to the clothing drop box operator licence or clothing drop box permit pages.
