Description

The WYSP uses devices called speed display signs or driver feedback signs which contain a radar device and an LED display. These signs are installed on a dedicated wooden pole. The radar measures the speeds of oncoming vehicles and the LED sign displays their speeds to the passing motorists, thereby reminding them to check their speeds and to obey speed limits. The Cityâ€™s permanent units are installed in Safety Zones. This dataset contains the locations and operating parameters for installed signs. See Detailed Speed Counts for hourly speed counts recorded by these signs and Monthly Summary Data for a monthly summary of these speed data

Limitations

    Sign addresses have not been verified. They may represent the address of the property adjacent to the sign, which may not be on the same street as the sign.
    The speed limit column is reflective of the most recent operating parameter and does not necessarily the current or previous speed limit at that location
