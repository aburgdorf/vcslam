Description

The street tree dataset includes a listing of public trees on boulevards in the City of Vancouver and provides data on tree coordinates, species and other related characteristics. Park trees and private trees are not included in the inventory.

Tree records that do not have coordinates data will not show up in the map view; consult the table view for full listing.
Data currency

The dataset is updated on a weekly basis. However, tree attributes are generally not updated on a regular basis and it may be several years between updates for many of those attributes. Priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected in the data.

The coordinates were primarily provided by the 2016 Tree Inventory project.
