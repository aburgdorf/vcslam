This data set provides locations and attributes of cultural spaces in the City of Vancouver, University Endowment Lands and Musqueam Community.

This dataset is published as part of the City of Vancouver Cultural Spaces Map Pilot Project. The data is verified and updated through a survey of stakeholders in the cultural community annually in June. In order for a space to be included, information associated with the space such as a website and contact information must be publically available.

The extract on this website will be updated annually or as necessary.

Data accuracy

Data is drawn primarily from public sources such as websites and brochures. Data for City of Vancouver spaces was compiled from various departments.

City staff selected the attributes for Primary Use and Ownership for each space.

For Square Feet and Number of Seats, data reported may have been calculated differently prior to publication.

There is no known error but there may be some loss of quality from data entry errors.
