Description

The dataset contains location and information of food vendors on Vancouver streets. It does not include business with roaming food vending permit.

Data currency

This data is updated in June and in the normal course of business as new information is available, however priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected in this dataset.

Data accuracy

The locations of street food vendors are based on the sites approved by the City. They will be very close to the exact locations but should be considered approximate.

There is no known error but there may be some loss of quality from data entry error as this data set is maintained manually.
