Moby bikes is an e-bike bikeshare scheme in operation in Dublin. Electric powered bicycles may be rented from and returned to designated cycle stands inside the designated area. The designated area and bicycle stands data are available as static resources (geoJSON attachments) and are also highlighted in the map explorer visualisation.
