isTaxableParcel?	
Y=taxable fee parcel; N=non-taxable non-fee parcel. Non-taxable non-fee parcels are identified by having 8th digit of AssessorID either 3, 8, or 9 (i.e. last 3 digits of AssessorID either 3xx, 8xx or 9xx). Assessed values for non-taxable parcels are relatively meaningless and so to avoid inadvertent comingling with taxable values, the assessed values and exemption values for NON-TAXABLE parcels have here been ZEROED-OUT. Also, because of lesser priority given to maintaining their property records, the parcel usage, building information, and even the property address shown here for non-taxable parcels may not be up-to-date.
