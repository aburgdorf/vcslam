Columns

WATERSHED	
The watershed where this data was collected (some data represents laboratory samples from products or other non-spatial data).
Plain Text
	
SAMPLE_DATE	
The date and time at which the sample was collected. Time is in 24 hour notation where 15:00:00 represents 3pm. Check against TIME_NULL column -- if that is set to true, then time is set to default.
Date & Time
	
SITE_NAME	
The name we use to identify the site. Most often this name is adequately descriptive to give you a good idea of where it is located if you have a detailed City of Austin map. Sometimes this descriptor is non-geographic.
Plain Text
	
SITE_TYPE	
Useful for grouping sites by springs creeks sediment and bmp locations. This also implies the type of data that we primarily collect at this site.
Plain Text
	
MEDIUM	
The type of material (groundwater, surface water, sediment) analyzed.
Plain Text
	
PARAM_TYPE	
A classification or grouping value for different parameters.
Plain Text
	
PARAMETER	
The "thing" that we analyzed the sample for or measured in the field (aka, the analyte).
Plain Text
	
QUALIFIER	
When the qualifier code = '<' or '<J' it means that the value in the result column represents the lowest possible limit of detection for that date and lab; if there was any of the analyte in the sample, it was present at less than the result value.
Plain Text
	
RESULT	
This is the "RESULT."
Number
	
UNIT	
Commonly used unit descriptions: mg/kg -- milligrams/kilogram aka Parts Per Million in sediment mg/l -- milligrams/liter aka PPM in water ug/kg; ug/l -- micrograms per unit volume aka Parts Per Billion in sediment and water
Plain Text
	
FILTER	
Filter Fraction: most often used to distinguish between dissolved and total analyte or juvenile/adult macroinvertebrates.
Plain Text
	
SAMPLE_ID	
Most commonly used to differentiate between different transects or survey areas at the same Sample location.
Plain Text
	
SAMPLE_SITE_NO	
System-assigned primary key for all Sample locations represented in this dataset.
Number
	
DEPTH_IN_METERS	
The depth at which the sample was collected in meters. This is a useful field for Lake data (specifically our Lady Bird Lake data collection) and is null for other samples.
Number
	
METHOD	
The "standard" method designation. Some labs use their own custom methods however we most often insist on EPA or EPA-approved methods. Unknown means we haven't gotten a description of the method from the lab.
Plain Text
	
QC_FLAG	
Flag assigned by an automated comparison process using guidelines set by COA staff. Flag Description U Results are completely usable. R Results are completely unusable. J Results are qualified as estimated. G No guidelines exist for this data.
Plain Text
	
PROJECT	
This is the Quality Assurance Project Plan Name under which the data was collected.
Plain Text
	
Location
Location
	
DATA_REF_NO	
This is a database reference number that can help us answer any questions you might have about a specific sample; primary key for this dataset (guaranteed unique but not necessarily contiguous).
Number
	
LAT_DD_WGS84	
Y coordinate in WGS_1984 decimal degrees (Commonly referred to as Latitude)
Number
	
LON_DD_WGS84	
X coordinate in WGS_1984 decimal degrees (Commonly referred to as Longitude)
Number
	
SAMPLE_REF_NO	
System-assigned unique key [Field_Sample_No] from FSDB that represents unique ID on samples.
Number
	
TIME_NULL	
When true, indicates that the Time in the Date/Time field is not precise; there was no ample_time recorded in the original data.
Plain Text
	
QC_TYPE	
For samples that were collected as part of a QA/QC plan ... Splits, Reps, Blanks, Etc.
