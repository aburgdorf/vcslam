Description

Pursuant to the umbrella of International Codes with New York State modifications and applicable chapters of the City Charter, the Department of Permit & Inspection Services (DPIS) responds to complaints or concerns to determine if properties are in compliance with the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code and City ordinances. Appropriate response is taken (i.e. no cause for action, letter of violation, referral to the appropriate agency, etc.) as a result of what the inspector finds at the property.


A general inspection means that a City inspector is responding to a complaint or concern given through 311 or other sources to ascertain validity.
