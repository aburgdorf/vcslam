DBH	
Diameter at breast height, or DBH, is a standard method of expressing the diameter of the trunk or bole of a standing tree (in inches) measured at 4.5 feet above ground level.
Number
	
Total Yearly Eco Benefits ($)	
The total dollar amount of benefits that a tree provides. This is a combination of greenhouse gas benefits, water benefits, energy benefits, air quality benefits, and property benefits.
Number
	
Stormwater Benefits ($)	
The total dollar amount of stormwater benefits that a tree provides by reducing the amount of runoff and pollutant loading in receiving waters
Number
	
Stormwater Gallons Saved	
The total amount of gallons of water saved by a tree as a result of intercepting and storing rainfall in leaves and branches, increasing soil infiltration through root growth and decomposition, reducing soil erosion by diminishing the impact of rain on barren surfaces, and reducing soil moisture thereby increasing the soil's capacity to store rainfall.
Number
	
Greenhouse CO2 Benefits ($)	
The total dollar amount of benefits that a tree provides by reducing atmospheric greenhouse gases
Number
	
CO2 Avoided (in lbs.)	
The amount of carbon dioxide (in pounds) that isn't released into the atmosphere as a result of a tree reducing the demand for heating and air conditioning of nearby buildings.
Number
	
CO2 Sequestered (in lbs.)	
The amount of carbon dioxide sequestered (in lbs.) by a tree as it grows.
Number
	
Energy Benefits ($)	
The total dollar amount of benefits that a tree provides by modifying climate and conserving building energy use.
Number
	
kWh Saved	
The amount of kilowatt hours of energy saved by shading and transpiration (converting liquid water to water vapor which cools the environment).
Number
	
Therms Saved	
The amount of therms of heat energy saved by reducing wind speeds.
Number
	
Air Quality Benefits ($)	
The total dollar amount of benefits that a tree provides by increasing air quality through absorption of gaseous pollutants, intercepting particulates, releasing oxygen, transpiring water, shading surfaces, lowering air temperatures and reducing ozone levels.
Number
	
Pollutants Saved (in lbs.)	
The total amount of pollutants saved (in pounds) by a tree through absorbing gaseous pollutants, intercepting particulates, and reducing ozone levels.
Number
	
Property Benefits ($)	
The total dollar amount of increased property value through the increased curb appeal of having a tree in front of a property. Research has shown that buyers are willing to pay more for homes with ample trees.
Number
	
Leaf Surface Area (in sq. ft.)	
The measure of the total area of all leaf surface on a tree (in square feet)
Number
