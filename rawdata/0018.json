        "Summary": "On June 24th, 2006, at approximately midnight, an off duty Seattle Police Officer was riding his personally owned motorcycle through Post Alley, northbound between Stewart St. and Virginia St. The alley contained approximately 50 to 100 people who were obstructing travel. In the course of transiting the alley, a female subject became agitated and confronted the officer. The female subject refused to move from the officers’ path and eventually mounted the front fender of the officer’s motorcycle, as the officer continued northbound toward Virginia St. Near the end of the alley the officer was unable to keep the motorcycle upright. The female subject was impeding the officers’ efforts to right the motorcycle. In the ensuing disturbance a crowd of people, apparently coming to the defense of the female subject, attacked the officer and forced him to the ground. The attackers proceeded to kick and punch the officer repeatedly in the face and head. The officer drew his department issued firearm and discharged approximately three rounds. Shortly after the officer fired a male approached in an apparent effort to continue the attack. The officer fired three additional rounds, striking the subject twice.  \n\nThe subject received two gunshot wounds, was transported to Harborview Medical Center where he was treated and survived."

Seattle Police Detectives located a subject matching the description of a person believed to be involved in a homicide they were investigating. The subject was sitting near the intersection of 5th Avenue and Denny Way. The subject had been observed in the area using the homicide victim’s credit card. The detectives took up a surveillance position in an unmarked Seattle Police vehicle and called for additional units to make the arrest. The subject began to move, on foot and the detectives maneuvered their vehicle to keep the subject in sight. While eastbound on Denny Way their vehicle malfunctioned and the detectives decided to detain the subject. As the detectives approached the subject they identified themselves as police, and ordered the subject not to move, at gunpoint. The subject charged one of the detectives and attempted to take control of his firearm. A physical altercation ensued and the detective fired two rounds. The subject slumped to the ground and was taken into custody. \n\nThe subject died at the scene."

The suspect in the shooting had left the scene and the handgun used had not been recovered. The officer and his K-9 partner tracked and did not locate the subject by 2:06 A.M. and the call was cleared.   \n\nThe officer later responded to a burglary call, and while at that call learned that people frequently use the alley behind the burglary victim’s house to access Pritchard Beach Park by jumping over a fence.  The Officer and his K-9 partner decided to check the park.  The gate was open, although the park is posted closed from 10:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M.   \n\nAs the officer checked the park, he noticed a person sitting on a bench facing Lake Washington.   The subject seated on the bench got up and began to move in a ‘flanking motion’ toward the officer.   The officer then noticed that the subject was carrying a bright colored handgun in his hand.  The officer gave commands to drop the weapon, secured his K-9 partner, and advised radio of the situation.   The suspect then began to raise his weapon toward the officer.  The officer fired 2-3 rounds that missed the subject.   The subject lowered the gun and then again pointed it at the officer.   The officer fired several more rounds at the subject.  The subject then lowered himself to the ground and lay on his back.  The officer maintained cover of the subject until other officers arrived and took the subject into custody.  \n\nThe subject was treated at the scene and then transported to Harborview Medical Center with non-life threatening injuries.   The subject was later booked into the King County jail and charged with Assault 1st Degree with a Deadly Weapon."

A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n\nAll three officers were referred to OPA by the Force Review Board who found the shooting to be not within policy.   OPA recommended discipline.  Discipline was overturned by Chief O'Toole."

        "Summary": "On Sunday, the 6th of December, 2015, at approximately 12:30 PM, several people in businesses beginning around Pike Place Market and continuing north along 1st Avenue, noted the behavior of a highly agitated male subject. Between 12:40 PM and 12:45, the subject carjacked a vehicle, at gunpoint, in the area of 3rd Avenue, between Bell and Blanchard. At 12:47 PM the Seattle Police Communications Center received the first of several emergency calls regarding the subject. The caller stated the subject was driving recklessly down the Burke Gilman Trail, five miles north of where the carjacking occurred. Over the next 45 minutes, the subject nearly struck at least one pedestrian, carjacked an additional two vehicles, threatened several community members with a weapon and was eventually located, at 1:32 PM, in the area of NE 54th and Revenna. Several officers joined the pursuit during which five attempts were made to “ram” or Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT), the subject. In the course of the pursuit, the subject fired on officers at least twice. At 1:53 PM, in the 900 block of N. Northlake Way, the fifth and final attempt to PIT the vehicle was successful in ending the pursuit but not disabling the vehicle. As the vehicle attempted to flee, an officer observed the subject point his weapon at another officer and opened fire. In total, eleven officers discharged their weapons more than 100 times into the vehicle, disabling it and the driver. \n\nView of the interior of the vehicle and the subject was obscured by airbags. Attempts to break the window with less-lethal, Blue Nose rounds were unsuccessful.  At 2:03 PM, a SWAT contact team approached the vehicle from the driver’s side. Upon opening the driver’s door, a SWAT officer observed movement from the subject and discharged his rifle multiple times, striking the subject. The subject was extracted from the vehicle and died at the scene."

Several officers joined the pursuit during which five attempts were made to “ram” or Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT), the subject. In the course of the pursuit, the subject fired on officers at least twice. At 1:53 PM, in the 900 block of N. Northlake Way, the fifth and final attempt to PIT the vehicle was successful in ending the pursuit but not disabling the vehicle. As the vehicle attempted to flee, an officer observed the subject point his weapon at another officer and opened fire. In total, eleven officers discharged their weapons more than 100 times into the vehicle, disabling it and the driver. \n\nView of the interior of the vehicle and the subject was obscured by airbags. Attempts to break the window with less-lethal, Blue Nose rounds were unsuccessful.  At 2:03 PM, a SWAT contact team approached the vehicle from the driver’s side. Upon opening the driver’s door, a SWAT officer observed movement from the subject and discharged his rifle multiple times, striking the subject. The subject was extracted from the vehicle and died at the scene."

        "Summary": "On the 9th of January, 2016, officers responded to the 1500 block of Queen Anne Ave N. for a report of an attempted auto theft. The subject attempted to flee in the car but struck a parked vehicle and fled into the surrounding neighborhood, on foot. An officer, wearing a police uniform and driving a marked police car, located the subject near the intersection of 2nd Ave W. and W. Highland St. and attempted to make contact. The subject, who was walking away from the officer, tuned to face him and withdrew two knives from his pockets. The subject advanced toward the officer, a knife in each hand. The officer pointed his firearm at the subject and ordered him to “drop the knives” as he walked backward from the subject and called for a “fast back” response from officer in the area. The subject continued to advance toward the officer’s car and became more aggressive. The officer fired four rounds, striking the subject. The subject fell to the ground and dropped the knives. Shortly thereafter the subject moved toward the officer’s car, opened the door and locked himself inside. At this time, three backup officers arrived and formed a contact team. The officer approached the car and attempted, twice, to Taser the subject through a partially open window but were not successful in gaining compliance from the subject. At this point, the officers used a spare key to unlock the door. The subject responded by throwing one of his knives at the officers but was taken into custody. \n\nOfficers provided first aid until the Seattle Fire Department arrived. The subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he recovered from his injuries."

        "Summary": "On the 21st of February, 2016, at approximately 3:38 PM, officers from the North Precinct Anti-Crime Team (ACT), who were conducting surveillance of a subject with a felony warrant in the area of 21st Ave. NE and NE 85th St., observed another subject, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, enter the residence under surveillance. At this time, officers requested additional resources with the intention of contacting the subject as he exited the residence. At 4:15 PM, the officers observed the subject, who had emerged from the residence earlier, approach and stand in the passenger door of another, occupied vehicle, which had arrived approximately one minute before. The ACT officers called for other units to “move in” and contact the subject.

        "Summary": "On the 11th of October 2016, at approximately 12:45 P.M., SPD personnel were in a joint effort with [CITY DEPARTMENTS] to abate a homeless encampment located in the East Duwamish Greenbelt, an area under Interstate 5 also known as The Jungle. In response to reports that several people were refusing to clear the area, a Captain and a Sergeant attempted a count, in an effort to evaluate the situation. As they were returning to the Command Post in a vehicle, the SPD personnel were flagged down by a Washington State Department of Transportation employee directing their attention to two men involved in a physical altercation, and utilized hand gestures to indicate a knife was present. The SPD personnel gave verbal commands and attempted to separate the two subjects, physically. As they were doing so, they identified sharp force injury to one of the subjects and observed a knife in the hand of the other. The Captain and the Sergeant pointed their firearms at the armed subject and ordered him to drop the knife. The subject stood up and pointed the knife at the SPD personnel. The subject then adjusted his grip on the weapon from underhand to overhand and continued to refuse commands to drop the weapon. The Sergeant fired their pistol three times, striking the subject in the chest. Seattle Fire Department (SFD) resources responded to give aid. \nThe was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. \nThe other subject involved in the physical altercation was also transported to Harborview Medical Center and treated for their injuries."

        "Summary": "On the 20th of April 2016, at approximately 1:18 P.M., Seattle Police Officers responded to a report of an armed robbery at a convenience store located in the 600 block of 1st Ave. The clerk reported two subjects (one female and one male) shoplifted several items from the store and when confronted, the male produced a pistol. Two officers on bicycles identified three subjects (one female and two males), two of which matched the descriptions provided by the convenience store clerk, walking northbound on 1st Ave and attempted to detain them in an investigative stop. One male subject was detained and determined to be unarmed. The other male subject and female subject fled on foot. After a short pursuit, officers caught up with the male subject and attempted to take him into custody. During the struggle, the female subject struck one of the officers in the head with a bottle and then attempted to place the officer in a chokehold, eventually the male subject was able to escape. Officers pursued and located the male subject at the Federal Reserve building, having entered through the loading dock. The officer pointed their firearm at the subject and ordered him to surrender his firearm. The subject fired on the officer, striking them in the lower abdomen of their ballistic vest. The officer returned fire, striking the subject. Three additional officers responded and evacuated the officer who was shot. The subject then fired again, striking a second officer in the jaw and a third officer in the thumb. Three officers returned fire, striking the subject multiple times. SPD SWAT, King County SWAT and K9 units responded to the scene. After several attempts to determine whether the subject was still a threat, a K9 was sent to extract the subject from the position where he fell following the earlier second exchange of gunfire.        \nParamedics attempted to render aid but determined the subject was deceased."

Task force members identified an opportunity to apprehend the subject, without endangering a female cohabitant and a child, and approached the subject. The SPD detective was concealed near the front of the residence. The remaining members approached the subject in an unmarked DOC vehicle with its emergency lights activated, positioning the vehicle behind a parked vehicle occupied by the subject and attempted contact. The subject accessed a firearm from the floor of the vehicle he was occupying and fled on foot, toward the front of the residence and the waiting SPD detective. The detective observed a firearm in the hand of the subject and yelled “Gun!” then “Seattle Police!” The subject raised the firearm toward the detective and the detective fired several rounds, striking the subject. A DOC Community Corrections Specialist (CCS) also fired on the subject, believing they had observed the subject fire on the SPD detective. Two spent casings were found at the scene, believed to be fired by the subject at the task force.\nThe subject was hit multiple times and fell onto the lawn. Aid was rendered at the scene and the subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he was treated and released into the custody of the Washington State DOC. \nThe subject was investigated for 1st degree Assault, for firing on the task force."

        "Summary": "On the 18th of June 2017, at approximately 9:00 A.M., a Seattle Police Officer responded to an apartment in the 6800 block of 62nd Ave Northeast, at the request of a resident to take a burglary report. Upon arriving, the officer was made aware of an “Officer Safety Caution” through a routine check of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Crime Information Computer (NCIC) system. The caution referenced a report of an incident occurring on the 5th of June 2017, in which the resident “brandished a large pair of scissors at officers.” The officer requested a second officer accompany him. A second officer arrived at approximately 9:40 A.M. and both officers briefed the June 5th incident which resulted in the officer safety caution and tactics to mitigate risk. At approximately 9:45, both officers contacted the apartment and were admitted by a female subject. For several minutes, the subject conversed calmly with the officers, answering their questions and identifying several items (including two gaming consoles) that were missing and reportedly stolen as result of the break-in. \nOne officer and the subject were in the hall entry just inside the door, with the subject facing the door and the officer facing the living room. The second officer was in the kitchen, to the left of the subject. The first officer was taking notes, within arm’s reach of the subject, when she drew a knife and slashed at the officer in front of her. The officer retreated, drew his firearm, ordered the subject to “get back!” and called for backup. The second officer was alerted by the commotion and drew his firearm, as the subject turned toward him and motioned as if attempting to throw the knife at him. The second officer ducked down to avoid being hit by the knife and when he returned to a standing position, observed two knives in the subject’s hands. Both officers issued repeated commands for the subject to “get back!” The subject repeatedly yelled “do it!”, while threatening the officers. Both officers fired on the subject, who was struck multiple times and fell at the entrance to the living room. \nTwo small children were present on the floor of the living room and an additional child emerged from an adjacent bedroom, after hearing gunfire. None of the children were injured. \nOfficers attempted to render aid after securing the scene. Seattle Fire Department paramedics arrived and attempted therapy. The subject died at the scene."

        "Summary": "On the 18th of June 2017, at approximately 9:00 A.M., a Seattle Police Officer responded to an apartment in the 6800 block of 62nd Ave Northeast, at the request of a resident to take a burglary report. Upon arriving, the officer was made aware of an “Officer Safety Caution” through a routine check of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Crime Information Computer (NCIC) system. The caution referenced a report of an incident occurring on the 5th of June 2017, in which the resident “brandished a large pair of scissors at officers.” The officer requested a second officer accompany him. A second officer arrived at approximately 9:40 A.M. and both officers briefed the June 5th incident which resulted in the officer safety caution and tactics to mitigate risk. At approximately 9:45, both officers contacted the apartment and were admitted by a female subject. For several minutes, the subject conversed calmly with the officers, answering their questions and identifying several items (including two gaming consoles) that were missing and reportedly stolen as result of the break-in. \nOne officer and the subject were in the hall entry just inside the door, with the subject facing the door and the officer facing the living room. The second officer was in the kitchen, to the left of the subject. The first officer was taking notes, within arm’s reach of the subject, when she drew a knife and slashed at the officer in front of her. The officer retreated, drew his firearm, ordered the subject to “get back!” and called for backup. The second officer was alerted by the commotion and drew his firearm, as the subject turned toward him and motioned as if attempting to throw the knife at him. The second officer ducked down to avoid being hit by the knife and when he returned to a standing position, observed two knives in the subject’s hands. Both officers issued repeated commands for the subject to “get back!” The subject repeatedly yelled “do it!”, while threatening the officers. Both officers fired on the subject, who was struck multiple times and fell at the entrance to the living room. \nTwo small children were present on the floor of the living room and an additional child emerged from an adjacent bedroom, after hearing gunfire. None of the children were injured. \nOfficers attempted to render aid after securing the scene. Seattle Fire Department paramedics arrived and attempted therapy. The subject died at the scene."

        "Summary": "On the 29th of September 2017, at approximately 9:30 P.M., Seattle Police Officers were dispatched to the 11200 block of Fremont Avenue North in response to multiple calls to 911 reporting a neighborhood dispute, involving the discharge of a firearm. Upon arriving, officers attempted to contact the subject who discharged the firearm, in the driveway of his residence. The subject retreated into his home and refused to surrender to police. Seattle Police Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT), K9 and mutual aid resources from the King County Sheriff’s Officer responded to the now barricaded subject. Over the next six hours, the subject made various threats to fire on officers. At approximately 3:30 AM, after several hours of negotiations, SWAT began tactical operations to encourage the subject to surrender, including the use of Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) gas or pepper gas. At approximately 4:20 A.M., SWAT, one Sergeant and two officers, approached the residence in an armored vehicle known as a Bearcat, to deploy the gas. As they approached, the subject opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun, striking the bearcat windshield on the driver’s side and the passenger rear view side mirror. A SWAT officer returned fire with a rifle, striking the subject in the hip. The subject retreated into the residence. OC gas was deployed into the residence, with no effect. Bellevue Police Department (BPD) SWAT and the Arson Bomb Squad (ABS) were requested as additional resources. After it was apparent the OC gas was not effective, SWAT deployed chlorobenzylidene malononitrile or CS gas, also known as “tear gas”, still with no effect. At approximately 5:20 A.M., a remote-controlled police robot was maneuvered to the front door and was used to communicate with the subject. After several minutes, the subject surrendered, and an arrest team was able to take him into custody. \nAid was provided on scene and the subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he was treated for his injuries.\nThe subject was booked into the King County Jail and held on charges of 1st Degree Assault, for firing on the officers in the Bearcat."

        "Summary": "On the 8th of October 2017, at approximately 7:30 P.M., a caller contacted the Seattle Police Communication Center via 911, to report a suspicious vehicle in the alley of the 2200 block of Yale Avenue East. The reporting party said the occupants of the vehicle, which was in an authorized-vehicle-only space, were in possession of weapons (a firearm and a sharp screwdriver). The caller, who had been observing the vehicle for more than twenty-minutes, reported an occupant was “loading and unloading” a firearm and another occupant was in possession of a sharp screwdriver, and said a male had run from the vehicle approximately 20 minutes earlier. The caller also reported he observed the occupants “wiping down” the door handles of the vehicle. At 7:33 P.M. four Seattle Police Officers responded to the incident, which was dispatched as a “weapons” call. While enroute to the call, one of the officers used the license plate reported by the reporting party to identify the vehicle as one involved in an incident on the 7th of October, in which the subjects fled from police. At 7:42 P.M., officers located the vehicle and approached. As the officers approached, the subjects became aware of their presence. Officers identified themselves as Seattle Police and ordered them to “get on the ground.” The subjects attempted to flee by driving forward, toward one of the officers. Two officers opened fire on the vehicle as it continued forward and then made a 90 degree turn northbound. The officers continued to fire as the vehicle drove away from them.\nThe subjects eluded officers and abandoned the vehicle as they fled northbound. \nTwo of the subjects were apprehended in Snohomish County on the 13th of October 2017. Both subjects were evaluated medically and reported superficial wounds to the back, received during the event.     \nThis incident was referred to the Office of Police Accountability (OPA) for investigation, resulting in multiple sustained findings against the two officers who fired their weapons. The department terminated the officers’ employment as a result."

At 11:34 P.M., officers noticed a vehicle parked nearby, with a male subject who appeared to be watching them. The officers requested backup and at 11:38 P.M., attempted to contact the vehicle. The vehicle fled and officers received permission to pursue. At approximately 11:46 P.M., as officers continued the pursuit eastbound in the area of 1st Avenue Northeast and North 80th Street, the occupant of the vehicle fired on officers through the driver’s side window. Four minutes later, the pursuit ended in Magnuson Park when the driver crashed through a heavy gate and then into a berm before fleeing on foot, into a wooded area. Six officers, including two rifle officers, formed a contact team and cleared the vehicle. Accompanied by a seventh officer operating a vehicle with a spotlight, officers continued along the road in the direction of a noise they believed to be the driver of the vehicle. Three additional officers joined the team and located the subject laying in the grass. Officers ordered the subject to show his hands. The subject stood up and responded to the officers’ commands by saying “for what bitch? For what? and lifted his shirt, while reaching toward his right hip.

The subject fired one round at the officer, who returned fire before taking cover. The subject continued to flee for several blocks westbound, eventually breaking into a home in the 6000 block of 27th Avenue Northeast and stealing the occupant’s vehicle, at gunpoint. The subject continued to flee, now in a vehicle. At 5:14 A.M., officers encountered the subject driving southbound, in the 5500 block of 26th Avenue Northeast and rammed the passenger side to disable the vehicle. Officers attempted to access the subject inside the vehicle but the doors were locked and the windows were up. The subject ignored repeated commands to surrender and continued to search the inside of the vehicle, apparently attempting to access a firearm. One officer fired five rounds, striking the subject. \n\nOfficers extracted the subject from the vehicle and attempted to render aid. Seattle Fire Department arrived at 5:23 A.M. and took over care.

        "Summary": "On the 31st of December 2018, at approximately 5:00 P.M., two Seattle Police Officers in a two-person unit (a single car occupied by two officers, dispatched as a single resource) initiated a traffic stop in the 9500 block of Aurora Avenue North. The vehicle was marked with emergency lights activated to signal the stop. The stop was conducted based on an observed illegal lane change. Additionally, a check of the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) system, indicated the registered owner of the vehicle had a “suspended / revoked” license. The driver of the vehicle complied with the traffic stop, pulling into a parking lot. As the vehicle came to a stop, the male driver attempted to exit the vehicle. Officers instructed the subject to remain in the vehicle and he complied. On initial contact with the occupants of the vehicle (a male driver and female passenger), officers determined the driver was not the registered owner the of vehicle and was not carrying identification but provided a name and date of birth. The officers returned to their vehicle to conduct a records check and determined the information provided by the driver was false. The officers requested additional units and two additional two-officer units arrived, as backup. Shortly after backup arrived, the driver fled the vehicle on foot, clutching the front of his sweatshirt with his right hand in a manner which lead officers to believe he was in possession of a weapon. All six officers pursued the subject across several lanes of traffic and into the 900 block of North 96th Street, where an officer used a takedown to bringing the subject to the ground. During the takedown a firearm fell from the subject, onto the ground. Officers continued to struggle to bring the subject into the prone position and control his hands. Officers issued commands for the subject to “stop reaching for the gun” and a closed fisted strike to the back. One officer attempted a brace contact shot from their firearm, against the subject’s forearm but the firearm was out of battery (a condition in which the firearm will not discharge). Another officer placed his firearm against the subject’s head and attempted, several times, a brace contact shot. The firearm was again, out of battery and did not discharge. The officer cleared the out of battery condition, placed the firearm against the subject’s head and fired one round, behind the left ear. \nOfficers took the subject into custody and rendered aid. The Seattle Fire Department arrived at 5:09 P.M. and took over care. The subject was pronounced dead at 5:11 P.M."

        "Summary": "On the 7th of February 2019, at 3:22 A.M., the Seattle Police Communication Center received a 911 call from a resident in the 10500 block of Midvale Avenue North. The caller reported hearing a female screaming for help in Spanish, asking for someone to “call the police.” At 3:28 A.M., the first of three Seattle Police Officers arrived at the location, an apartment building and began investigating. A witness directed them to a unit in the apartment complex, where the officers attempted contact but received no reply. The officers began to clear the area and were in the parking lot when the Communication Center received a 911 call from inside the unit the officers just attempted to contact. The female caller said repeatedly, “He killed her.” At 3:41 A.M., officers, dressed in full uniform and announcing themselves as Seattle Police made forced entry with their weapons drawn and began clearing the apartment. Through their search of the unit, officers identified a door which was significantly damaged and appeared as though someone had kicked, punched, or cut through it. Officers announced themselves and forced entry into the room. The door opened only partially, as it was blocked by a body of an adult female, decapitated, laying on the floor, in a significant quantity of blood. Officers observed a male subject in the room, just past the body, holding a large kitchen knife and a meat cleaver. Officers ordered the subject to drop the weapons and get down on the floor. The subject complied initially, responding in a mix of English and Spanish, “show my your placa [badge]”. The subject became agitated, stood up and began searching the room. Officer ordered the subject to stop in Spanish (“Alto!”) and identified themselves as “Policia!” The subject eventually located the weapons and began to advance on the officers. When the subject was approximately five or six feet from the officers, two of the officers fired on the subject five times. The subject was hit multiple times and fell. The subject attempted to stand up again, with the knife in his hand. One officer fired a single additional round, causing the subject to fall once more, throwing the knife.  \nOfficers secured the subject and began to render aid. Seattle Fire Department paramedics responded and took over care. The subject died at the scene. \nThe second female subject who called 911 was located, barricaded in an adjacent room."

A rifle equipped officer and a ballistic shield were requested and responded to the area. An officer with a less lethal, 40 mm multiple rubber baton projectile was also on scene.

        "Summary": "On the 5th of May 2019, at approximately 2:05 A.M., officers were in the Pioneer Square area monitoring bar closings when they heard gunfire they believed to be coming from a parking garage in the 500 block of 2nd Avenue. As officers converged on the parking garage, one Seattle Police Officer observed a subject on an upper deck of the garage discharge a handgun in the direction of officers and pedestrians below. The officer fired two rounds at the subject, who ducked down, out of sight. When the subject returned to a standing position, the firearm was no-longer visible. Other officers established cover and continued the response. A short time later, officers stopped a vehicle attempting to exit the garage and detained three subjects. The driver admitted he was in possession of a handgun. A passenger of the vehicle had a gunshot wound to the lower leg. Officers investigating an assault, nearby, recovered private video showing a physical altercation between the occupants of the vehicle and other subjects. During this altercation, the driver was observed discharging a firearm, in the direction of the wounded subject. Bodyworn Video and statements made by the officer who fired on the subject, suggest the officer did not fire on the subject who was wounded. Additionally, the subject the officer fired upon was only visible from the waist up. The subjects’ legs were not visible or in the line of fire of the officer.\nThe subject was charged with felony assault. Statements made by the subject to Homicide Detectives conducting follow-up, indicated the subject was unaware he had been fired on by police and was only made aware, after the fact. \nThrough the force investigation it appears the man fired at an unidentified subject and was himself shot and wounded by another party. SPD officers saw the man fire his gun and fired at him, but forensic analysis, including the trajectory of officers’ rounds found in a nearby building and a walkway obscuring the man’s lower extremities from officers’ line of fire—indicates his wounds were not caused by officers’ gunfire."

The caller was barricaded in a room inside the residence and reported the boyfriend was still in the residence, armed with a knife. Three Seattle Police Officers responded and attempted contact through the door. The officers identified themselves and ordered the door to be opened. When no response was received, the officers forced entry. Upon entry, the subject was observed, just inside the residence, shirtless, with a knife. Officers, dressed in full uniform, ordered the subject to drop the knife and surrender. The subject refused to comply and advanced on the officers. Two officers fired ten rounds, striking the subject. Officers cleared the residence and took the subject into custody. At 7:33 P.M., paramedics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived on scene and began rendering aid. \nThe subject died at the scene."

The other caller reported observing a female discharging a weapon in a nearby parking lot. While officers were enroute, updated information was received indicating the subject was running east on South Jackson Street and was still discharging the firearm. At approximately 8:12 P.M., officers located a subject matching the description in the area of 10th Avenue South and South Jackson Street. The subject was crouched on the sidewalk near the intersection. Officers, dressed in full uniform, approached the subject and repeatedly ordered her to “Stop” and show them her hands. The subject, now in the crosswalk, walking toward the officers with a bag and a blanket in her hands, refused to comply with commands to “sit down.” The subject was seen accessing her waistband, before abruptly dropping the bag and the blanket and pivoting away from the officers. Officers observed a handgun in the subject’s hand. The subject turned toward and raised the firearm to point it at the officers. The officers opened fire, striking the subject once, in the shoulder. \nThe subject fell to the ground and was taken into custody. Officers rendered aid until paramedics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived and took over care. \nThe subject was transported Harborview Medical Center where she was treated for her injuries. The subject was then transferred to the King County Jail and was charged with 2nd Degree Assault, Theft of a Firearm and Unlawful Possession of a Firearm."
